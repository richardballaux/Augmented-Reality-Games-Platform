## @Authors: Richard Ballaux, Viktor Deturck, Leon Santen


## What this game is about
This game is a two-player game. Each player needs a controller in form a green object that is recognized by the laptop's camera.
To select the settings, one of the two players needs to hover with their 'controller' over the corresponding setting they are trying to change. After having selected all necessary settings for the game, the game starts automatically.
Each player controls the height of their paddle with their controller by changing the height of the green object they are holding.
